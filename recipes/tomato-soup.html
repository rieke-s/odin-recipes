    <h2>Super Simple Soup</h2>
    <p>A simple 5 ingredient tomato soup made with butter, onion, and canned San Marzano tomatoes. This hits the cozy vibes just right.</p>
    <h3>Ingreditents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>two 28-ounce cans San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, peel removed and cut into 4 chunks</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves smashed garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the Tomato Soup:</b> Put the tomatoes, butter, and onion in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring it up to a low bubble, then turn the heat to medium low. Cover partially with a lid; let it simmer for 45 minutes. Stir every 15 minutes or so to prevent scorching on the bottom.</li>
        <li><b>Remove Onion Chunks:</b> Remove the onion pieces using tongs. I leave the garlic in there, but that’s up to you!</li>
        <li><b>Blend the Tomato Soup:</b> Using an immersion blender, blend up the soup until it’s a smooth as you want it. Taste and adjust; you can thin it out with milk, water, broth, cream, whatever you want; I just leave it as-is! </li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Serve tomato soup with garlic bread, grilled cheese, croutons, crackers, pesto, whatever you like!</li>
    </ol>
